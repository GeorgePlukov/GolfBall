# BlueBalls
A "smart golfball" made for Hack the North at the University of Waterloo in 2015. With a team of four people we succesfully placed a modified intel Blue Bean sensor (Bluetooth and acellerometer) into the golf ball. With this chip inside the ball you could wirelessly connect to it from your phone and track your miniputting score and even bet with friends!

## Features 
* Tracking of score sheet for mini-putt games
* Organizing mini-putt games with friends
* Betting against friends on certain holes, shots, or games using paypal
